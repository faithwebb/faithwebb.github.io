# Some of the most useful parenting ideas I know.

## Idea #1

Reuse plastic zip bags for poopy diapers to seal in the smell.
This is great for both travel and home use and eliminates the need for a special diaper pail to keep the odor contained
(and the need to buy special replacement diaper pail trash bags).
I simply reuse the sandwich size or larger zip bags that previously contained snacks and other food.
Waste not, want not. :)

## Idea #2
Involve your young children in helping with household chores.
Not only is it setting up a good practice but it also might be the only way you'll get anything done around the house.
It's a win-win situation:
your child feels good about being a big helper while learning how things work in a household and forming a habit of helping out with chores.
Children are quick to see through shams,
so make sure that what they are doing is actually contributing to the completion of the task. 

For instance, my son likes to help me throw the dirty laundry into the washing machine
(after I hand it to him) and push the clean wet laundry into the dryer
(after I drop it onto the dryer door that opens out and down).
He has been doing that since he was around a year old.
He also likes to help me sort clean laundry into two piles:
his clothes and my clothes (my husband does his laundry separately).
He enjoys helping me do dishes so much that he doesn't want to stop even when they're all clean
(he soaps and I rinse;
sometimes I have to resoap, telling him the dish was extra oily)

## Idea #3
Say yes as much as possible.
I try not to say no unless I have to do so.
This sounds like I spoil my son, but actually, it just makes him more cooperative in general since he knows I don't say no unless there's a good reason.
Research shows that for every no, you have to have three or more yeses in order to balance out the no and create a positive environment where the child feels like his/her requests are mostly fulfilled.
It doesn't have to be big yeses.
Simple ones like "yes, we can go to the park" or "yes, you can use the markers" count.
