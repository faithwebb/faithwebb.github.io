# Faith Webb's Blog

[Some of the most useful parenting ideas I know](/ideas/) |
[Sept. 4, 2019](/ideas/2019-09-04-the-most-useful-parenting-ideas-I-know.md)

Hi, I'm Faith, a relatively new mom with a 2.5 year old son and a daughter on the way.
My philosophy on raising children is to enjoy them while we still have them,
to make learning fun and every day an adventure,
and to take the path of least resistance as long as it's safe and not against our values.
Of course, I'm not perfect and therefore don't always live up to my ideals,
but I try my best, which is all that any of us imperfect parents can do.

I'm writing this blog mainly in the hopes that my parenting experiences will be helpful to other new parents.
As a brand new parent, I definitely benefited from other parents' experience and knowledge,
and I would like to pay it forward.
Most of the content will be helpful ideas/tips, funny stories, and product comparisons.
